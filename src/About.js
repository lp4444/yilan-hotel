        The project demonstrates the tool that we can search the hotels in yilan
        according to specific conditions, e.g., district and hotel category. The
        used API in the project was from MOTC Transport API provided by Ministry
        of Transportation and Communications R.O.C. Also, we consider Responsive
        Web Design (RWD) and pagination for more comfortable experience to
        readers.
