# The Yilan-Hotel

### Introduction

The Yilan-Hotel demonstrates the tool that we can search the hotels in yilan according to specific conditions, e.g., district and hotel category. The used API in the project was from MOTC Transport API provided by Ministry of Transportation and Communications R.O.C. Also, we consider Responsive Web Design (RWD) and pagination for more comfortable experience to readers.
